## Running CLI with local modifications

React Native is distributed as npm packages, `rn-redux`. React Native framework code and is installed locally into your project when you run `rn-redux init`.


## Install RN-Redux CLI

### Install
```bash
npm i -g rn-redux
```

## Running the local CLI

Now that the packages are installed in sinopia, you can install the new `rn-redux` package globally and when you use `rn-redux init`, it will install the new `rn-redux` package as well:

```bash
rn-redux init AwesomeApp
rn-redux init AwesomeApp --version 0.55.3
```
